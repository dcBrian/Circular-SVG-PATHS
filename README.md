## Circular SVG PATHS :dart:
This is a little experiment I made to increase my knowledge on the different ways to use SVG in web development. With this project, I wanted to demonstrate how we could use SVG PATHS to render a text on a custom Path. If you feel it can help you with something, feel free to use partly or totally this code.
